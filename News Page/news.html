        The Grammy winning electronic duo from France Daft Punk, known for their iconic helmets and for also producing
        music ahead of their time. They disbanded in 2021 but have given us timeless classic hits such as ‘Get Lucky’
        'Around the world' and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger'. This duo has been under the spotlight again after
        being inactive for years as they’ve released a 10th anniversary edition of one of their most memorable albums
        ‘Random Access Memories’, originally released in May, 2013. This special edition includes several unreleased
        tracks as well as other hidden gems that weren’t featured in the original release. Despite disbanding, the
        members still produce independent music to this date.
